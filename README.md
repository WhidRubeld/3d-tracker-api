# 3D TRACKER Server API

## Getting started

However, instead of repeatedly typing vendor/bin/sail to execute Sail commands, you may wish to configure a Bash alias that allows you to execute Sail's commands more easily:

```bash
alias sail='bash vendor/bin/sail'
```

Once the Bash alias has been configured, you may execute Sail commands by simply typing sail. The remainder of this documentation's examples will assume that you have configured this alias:

```bash
# up docker container
$ sail up

# run migration
$ sail artisan migrate
```
